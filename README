To use the code, run the script learn_from_data.m or the function graph_learning_our
learn_from_data:
There are some modifications to the script needed to use on your own data: 
	-load the data at the beginning
	-for the purposes of graph tresholding, provide an approximate number of expected edges in variable nedges
	-change the number of atoms that describe a signal (maybe you want them to be larger in larger graphs)
	-adjust the parameters for gradient descent alpha and n_epochs, as well as graph sparsity beta
Some other parameters can be adjusted throughout the code if needed

graph_learning_our:
To call this function, variable param must be specified with a lot of parameters that can all be changed, similarly to learn_from_data. Signals should be given in param.y. It also takes alpha for gradient descent, beta for graph sparsity and maxEpochs for number of GD iterations.

This code is complementary to the work published at https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/224359/files/icassp_final.pdf
